# NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day

This app allows users to browse NASA's archive of Astronomy Picture of the Day (or APOD), which had been updating daily since 1995. Users can enter a date, and the app will load the picture published on that date, along with its title, description, and copyright.

Built on HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, React, and Redux. API powered by [NASA API's](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html).

Basic MVP done. Features in progress:
* Add support for video media type.
* Add styling to `ContentDetails` component.
* Additional support for mobile (For example, use regular picture instead of HD).
* More detailed `README.md`.
